# Component Documentation: Profile

## Purpose
Displays user profile information and provides logout functionality. Serves as a protected route that requires user authentication.

## Dependencies
- React Hooks: useEffect, useNavigate
- Redux Hooks: useSelector, useDispatch
- Routing: react-router-dom
- Redux Slice: authSlice

## Authentication Flow
- Automatically redirects to login page if no user is authenticated
- Renders nothing (null) if no user is present
- Prevents unauthorized access to profile page

## Redux State Dependencies
- `state.auth.user`: Current authenticated user object
  - Expected properties:
    - `username`: User's display name
    - `email`: User's email address

## Key Functions
### `onLogout()`
- Dispatches logout action to Redux store
- Navigates user back to home page ('/') after logout

## Side Effects
### Authentication Check
- Runs on component mount and when user state changes
- Redirects to login page if no user is authenticated

## User Interactions
- View personal profile information
- Logout from the application

## Security Considerations
- Protected route that requires authentication
- Immediate redirection if user is not logged in
- Prevents rendering of sensitive information without authentication

## UI Sections
1. Heading Section
   - Page title
   - Subtitle describing the page purpose

2. Content Section
   - Displays user information
   - Logout button

## Potential Improvements
- Add profile editing functionality
- Display more user details
- Add confirmation modal before logout
- Handle potential loading states during logout

## Error Handling
- Graceful handling of missing user data
- Automatic redirection for unauthenticated users

## Styling
- Uses CSS module for component-specific styling
- Modular approach to component styling
