# Component Documentation: FilterSection

## Purpose
Provides an interactive filtering interface for the Plant Encyclopedia, allowing users to dynamically filter plants based on multiple categories and criteria.

## Dependencies
- React
- PropTypes for type checking
- Styling: `FilterSection.module.css`

## Props
### Required Props
- `filters`: Object containing current filter selections
  - `light`: Array of selected light conditions
  - `water`: Array of selected watering needs
  - `difficulty`: Array of selected plant difficulty levels
  - `type`: Array of selected plant types

- `onFilterChange`: Callback function to update filters in parent component

## Filter Categories
1. Light
   - Options: 
     - Low Light
     - Medium Light
     - Indirect Sun
     - Full Sun

2. Water
   - Options:
     - Low
     - Moderate
     - Frequent

3. Difficulty
   - Options:
     - Easy
     - Moderate
     - Expert

4. Type
   - Options:
     - Indoor
     - Outdoor
     - Succulent
     - Tropical
     - Herb

## Key Functions
### `handleFilterClick(type, value)`
- Manages filter selection logic
- Toggles filter options on/off
- Supports multi-select functionality
- Updates parent component's filter state

## Interaction Flow
1. User clicks on filter button
2. `handleFilterClick` determines current filter state
3. Adds or removes filter option
4. Calls `onFilterChange` with updated filters
5. Parent component updates global filter state

## UI Characteristics
- Dynamically generated filter buttons
- Capitalize first letter of filter categories
- Active filters visually distinguished
- Responsive button styling
- Accessibility attributes for better user experience

## Accessibility Features
- `aria-pressed` attribute for filter buttons
- `role="switch"` for interactive filter buttons
- Semantic HTML structure
- Clear visual indication of active filters

## Prop Type Validation
- Uses PropTypes for runtime type checking
- Ensures `filters` is an object with specific array structures
- Requires `onFilterChange` to be a function
- Provides runtime warnings for incorrect prop types

## Potential Improvements
- Add tooltip explanations for filter options
- Implement reset or clear all filters functionality
- Add more granular filtering options
- Create collapsible filter sections for mobile view
- Support for range-based filters (e.g., plant size)

## Performance Considerations
- Minimal re-rendering through efficient state management
- Uses functional approach for filter toggling
- Lightweight component design

## Error Handling
- Graceful handling of undefined or empty filter states
- Prevents errors through PropTypes validation
- Provides default empty arrays for filter categories

## Styling Approach
- Modular CSS for component-specific styling
- Supports dynamic class application
- Provides visual feedback for active filters

## Use Cases
- Filtering plants in encyclopedia view
- Helping users find plants matching specific criteria
- Improving user discovery of plant information

## Design Patterns
- Compound component pattern
- Controlled component approach
- Separation of concerns between filtering logic and presentation
